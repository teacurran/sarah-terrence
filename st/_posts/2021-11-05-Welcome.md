Well, hi there! Glad you could make it. We’re building this site to help share all of the changes that transpired over the course of 2020-2021. There have been lots of twists and turns, but we’re both very excited to have landed in Vermont together, and look forward to sharing with you all.  

We'll continue to post updates and posts [here](https://www.mostlycats.pizza/), but have built specific pages for our big news: [Our Wedding](https://www.mostlycats.pizza/wedding/), [The House](https://www.mostlycats.pizza/the-house/), and [The Homestead](https://www.mostlycats.pizza/the-homestead/). 

The [Projects](https://www.mostlycats.pizza/projects/) Section is where we highlight what we're workiing on and daydreaming about. 

We're eager to share, and still tinkering and building the site- so bear with us as we tweak and refine the site formatting, images and text.
