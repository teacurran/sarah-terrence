We are currently living in a 200 year old farmhouse in Groton, Vermont. Terrence began looking at properties the summer of 2020, and on January 6th, 2021 closed on this property in Vermont.

The brick house was built by Robert Taisey in 1840, the barn shortly thereafter. The White House was built by Robert Taisey’s son George in 1880s.

We’ve made ourselves quite cozy in the brick house. There are a few big projects (modernizing the kitchen, refreshing the bathrooms and also infrastructure work like electric/plumbing and basement cleanout.

The barn and white house will require some structural work, with the White House needing major interior renovation (been abandoned for quite some time).

The Historical Society of Groton has been a great resource for learning about the history of the house and the town. I attended their Late summer open house and got to talking with President of the Historical Society. When I shared I lived in Groton in the brick house, the President of the Historical society got very excited and showed me the painting of our house that is part of their collection. She also shared with me the file on our house, entitled, “The Brick House of Groton”

The painting revealed some key information about the property, and reinforced the importance of taking a deeper look at the white house and its construction. To be honest, my first impression of both was that they needed to be torn down. After some online sleuthing and a thorough inspection of the interiors, we have changed our minds. The story of the house and it’s owners is rich, and we look forward to sharing more as we document our findings.
