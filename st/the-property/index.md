## The Property

The property is about Terrence and I have been hiking nearly every day, and have been mapping and scouting the property.

Thus far, weâ€™ve counted and mapped 50+ Apple Trees, that go all the way back- indi ating to us that the property was mostly clear-cut with pasture and apple trees all the way to the neighboring property- with trees seemingly lining the roads/ trails.

Maple: Yesterday Terrence mapped the tap lines- seems like there are about 150 total trees tapped in the south east portion of the property
