We were married October 22, 2021 at the City Hall in Providence, Rhode Island. The ceremony was officiated by a judge, with just our families present. We celebrated with a meal at [New Rivers](https://www.newriversrestaurant.com/), our favorite restaurant in Providence, followed the next day by a brunch hosted at the Curranâ€™s.  We are waiting on the photos from our photographer but here are some snapshots that capture the weekend perfectly.
