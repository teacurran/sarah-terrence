The pond is located at the base of a ravine in the hills to the west of the house. The path extends from the yard past the chicken coop and through the berry bramble up to a clearing circled by apple trees. 

The pond is manmade, and is fed from water running off the hills. We know that the pond freezes over in the winter, but we've seen fish- so it must be deep! The previous owner shared photos of ice skating on the pond, and we've also found some hockey sticks. 

We're hoping to make the pond swimmable in the summer, and perhaps have a little boat.
