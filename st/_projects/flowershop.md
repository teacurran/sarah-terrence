## The Flower Shop

One of my projects this coming summer now that Iâ€™ve graduated from container gardening is to plant a kitchen garden, a flower cutting garden, and to cultivate a wider variety of native perennials in the hillside meadows. Terrence has been talking about bees, and so the flower shop will be a nice companion to this venture.
